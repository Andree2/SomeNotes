        <p>This is a little PHP/JavaScript/SQL-based webpage I created to organize most of my stuff. Basically, I wanted something I can use as a diary/life log and which stores the data in a simple format, so I'll be able to read it for a long time.</p>

<p>The result is a web-interface which looks like a calendar and is used to read/write from a MySQL database. This database mainly contains four tables: <em>Notes</em>, <em>Events</em>, <em>Persons</em> &amp; <em>Tags</em>. And there's another table which stores links between these items. So it's used as a diary by creating events and linking them to persons or notes. It's also my ToDo-List by having a tag <em>ToDo</em> and linking it to notes, my recipe book by having a tag... well, you get the idea.</p>
