This database mainly contains four tables: <em>Notes</em>, <em>Events</em>, <em>Persons</em> &amp; <em>Tags</em>. And there's another table which stores links between these items. So it's used as a diary by creating events and linking them to persons or notes. It's also my ToDo-List by having a tag <em>ToDo</em> and linking it to notes, my recipe book by having a tag... well, you get the idea.</p>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
